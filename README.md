In this project-based i had build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using Python.  employed the scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting. working with the very popular Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper. By the end of this project, i able to explain the core ideas of linear regression to technical and non-technical audiences, build a simple linear regression model in Python with scikit-learn, employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to small data sets with seaborn and pandas, and evaluate a simple linear regression model using appropriate metrics.
Used pandas for data management and seaborn for plotting. Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through TV, Radio, and Newspapers. Predicted Sales-Revenue based on advertising data, used pandas & seaborn libraries. Built a linear regression model in python evaluated metrics.
